The line graph compares the areas of land for growing organic crops in two different countries during the period from 1985 to 2010.
　　In 1985, the areas of land for organic crops in country A and B were both 25 thousand hectares. In the following five years, the figures experienced a slight increase and reached 60 and 30 thousand hectares in 1990, after which they speeded up and rose to 160 and 140 thousand hectares respectively.
　　From 1995 on, the figure for country B continued to grow and peaked at 280 thousand hectares in 2000. After remaining stable for five years, the area dropped dramatically to less than 150 thousand hectares. By contrast, there was a small increase in the figure for country A from 1995 to 2000. After that, the area declined, although it still outnumbered that for country B in 2010.
　　Overall, in the first 15 years, the areas of land for organic crops increased in these two countries, while the figures dropped in the next 10 years.

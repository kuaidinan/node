The realization of basic human needs such as enough clothing and food makes it necessary for a more advanced spiritual enjoyment from art. For those who devote themselves to creating aesthetic works and pleasure, I think they should be supported by both government and other resources.
　　The government, as the central power that can accumulate a wealth of resources and execute them more systematically, should take the main responsibility to fund the artists. Most of the museums and art galleries are run and managed by governments and artists can be financially supported if the government makes it more accessible for artists to have their works of art exhibited. The authority can also issue some policies or regulations favoring the creation of innovative works of art, such as the reduction of tax levied on the artists and more subsidies for the encouragement of their contribution.
　　It is also true that the financial support from governments alone can hardly guarantee a decent pay or income for the artists. Funding from governments sometimes has to be allocated to the areas that are more concerned with the welfare of most of the citizens, such as health insurance and government loans for the students from disadvantaged families. In this case, the financial support from other sectors such as big companies or some non-governmental organisations can fit in. Some companies can carry out a series of exhibitions to raise more funds for artists and it is advisable for them to help publicise the works of artists on some media.
　　To sum up, if joint efforts from both governments and other resources are made to fund those who are engaged in the field of arts, chances are that the artists will be better-off and create more valuable masterpieces that can elevate people’s spiritual world.
